MITgcm model code to reproduce the results of Poinelli 2025a and Poinelli 2025b. 

The model output consisting of 10 TB of data including daily, weekly and monthly output for a nominal time frame of 01-Jan-2010 to 01-Nov-2010.
Model output is available on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC) with the ECCO-drive at https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/ECCO2/High_res_PIG/ASE_Poinelli2025 (registration is required).
